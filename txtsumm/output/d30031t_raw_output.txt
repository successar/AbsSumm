The six astronauts connected the first two building blocks of the international space station .
Such a blind docking had ever been attempted .
Currie is to reach out with the robot arm and pull the russian unit .
It was slow going ; she wanted and needed perfect alignment .
The shuttle contains the second station components to snap together .
The historical moment occurred above the south pacific .
The space shuttle robot arm to place zarya .
The astronauts on monday to attach electrical connectors and cables between the two components .
Mission control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks .
But everything occurred more or less when and how it was supposed to , aside from a piece of space junk that strayed too close .
Before beginning their final approach to zarya , the six astronauts had to steer clear of a chunk of a rocket launched last month from california .
The main cargo thursday was the unity chamber aboard the shuttle .
Mission control ordered the shuttle endeavour and the space debris .
The smaller gap would have been probably a little too close for comfort , mission control said .
The bigger worry , by far , was over endeavour 's pursuit and capture of zarya , and its coupling with unity .
Then , sunday , the astronauts are to rendezvous with the module that was launched from kazakstan on nov. 20 .
It will provide all the necessary electricity and steering for the fledgling space station until a permanent control module can be launched next summer .
Minutes after zarya 's capture , cabana called down that two antennas on the module were still undeployed as russian flight controllers had feared .
The antennas must be fully deployed in order for zarya 's manual docking system to work ; that system wo n't be needed before next summer , officials said .
The only other problem was with a zarya battery ; the astronauts took up a replacement part .
The 36-foot , 25,000-pound unity will serve as a connecting passageway , or vestibule , for future modules .
In case zarya and unity could not be connected with the robot arm , two spacewalking astronauts to manually fit them together .
It looked to be a perfect and , hopefully , long-lasting fit .
In all , three spacewalks are planned for endeavour 's 12-day flight .
The joined modules will be released from endeavour once all of the work is completed .
Nasa estimates 43 more launches and 159 more spacewalks to assemble the entire structure .
Once completed , the 16-nation space station will have a mass of 1 million pounds , be longer than a football field , and house up to seven astronauts and cosmonauts .
Seeing zarya , commander robert cabana announced the two pieces together .
Congratulations to the crew is to bring endeavour , replied mission control .
The 240-mile-high construction job began two hours earlier with nancy currie 's capture of zarya ( russian for sunrise ) using the shuttle robot arm .
Then came the hard part of the mission .
The two station contractor proposed the orbital change was part of the new station .
