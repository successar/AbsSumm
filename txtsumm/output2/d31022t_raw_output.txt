Binan atta was walking to the macedonian association when he saw the fire .
His skin was red and bubbly , atta said .
I saw about 10 people in windows who just jumped .
The fire had been burning undetected for some time .
The hall was packed far beyond its capacity .
... Others kicked out the windows and jumped out .
Ambulances were called in from several nearby communities .
The goteborg rescue services also brought city buses into service to help transport the injured .
Maybe you have teen-agers yourself and know how they are ...
