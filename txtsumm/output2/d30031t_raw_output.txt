It looked to be a perfect and , hopefully , long-lasting fit .
Then came the hard part of the mission .
Such a blind docking had ever been attempted before .
It was slow going ; she wanted and needed perfect alignment .
The historical moment occurred above the south pacific .
Mission control gave the astronauts plenty of time for the tasks .
The only other problem was with a zarya battery ; the astronauts took up a replacement part .
The joined modules will be released from endeavour once all of the work is completed .
