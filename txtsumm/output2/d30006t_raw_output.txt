While the decision to cancel the preseason games .
The league canceled the entire 114-game preseason on monday .
In this union battle it is the interests of the game .
The owners , the talks featured what the players .
And i think the league feels the same way .
Whatever figure over that number reduces the salary cap the next year .
If the figure was $ 29 million per season .
He estimated the losses into the hundreds of millions of dollars .
We would have to be stupid and ignorant to accept that deal .
